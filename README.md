DL-Techniques-for-Anomaly-Detection-using-SDN

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing **Deep Learning techniques for anomaly detection in Software-Defined Networking (SDN) environments**. The goal is to detect **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and other network anomalies in real time** to enhance network security and operational efficiency.


🎯 Key Objectives

- Develop deep learning-based models to detect DDoS and network anomalies.
- Collect and preprocess network traffic data from SDN environments.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover hidden patterns.
- Train, evaluate, and compare the performance of different DL models.
- Deploy the selected model in an SDN controller for real-time anomaly detection.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Ryu SDN Controller
- Mininet (for SDN network emulation)

📊 Deep Learning Models Implemented

- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Autoencoders
